Part 1 and 3)
I deleted all of the duplicates in the transactions table. I've given the transactions table a primary key.
I also deleted the duplicates in the updated operates table and dropped the date attribute to accommodate the 
updated table. Please replace the "root" and "password" in the src folder in Zhang_projectCode.zip. 

*** VIDEO DEMO ***

I could not upload the demo video onto Sakai (probably because there's a file size limit) so here
is a link to an unlisted youtube video of my video demo:

If there is any issue with this link or the video. I emailed Valia a copy of my video.
