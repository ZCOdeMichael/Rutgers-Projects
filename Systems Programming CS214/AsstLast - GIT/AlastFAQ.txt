Hash:
	don't have to write own
	can use openssl
		(advise looking in to MD5)
	implied: can load openssl library (-l on command line)


destroy:
	removes from server side, not necessarily from client
	
(files/dirs not under source control do not appear in Manifest and are ignored)

	if changes exist on the client side, still do remove from Manifest

	
archive:
	represent as you like
	(no higher up than server's current working directory, though)


multi-commit maintenance and expiry?
	...?

.Manfiest:
	starts from CWD that client is called in, which is parent directory of all projects on client side:
		./
			proj0/
			proj1/
			proj2/
	

names in commands:
	./WTF add proj0 file1
	
	./WTF add proj0 sub0/subsub92/file716


Compression:
		use libs to do it for realsies!
