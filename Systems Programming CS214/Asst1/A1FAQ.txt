1. Can we compress a single file and all files in another folder 
If it is valid: ./fileCompressor -c  1 2 3 Huffmancodebook -> check how many args here, and use the last one as Huffmancodebook
# of args:
> No.
If not valid: ./fileCompressor -c 1 2 3 Huffmancodebook --> 2 -> might be consider as the Huffmancodebook 
> Yes.
